# Asg-5
**a) Purpose of the Program(s):** The purpose of the prime program is to get the user to enter an integer and print all prime numbers between 2 and the inputted number.

The purpose of the triangle program is to get the user to input an integer number of rows and print Pascalâ€™s triangle with that many rows. 

**b) Input:** The prime # program's input is the prime # given by the user. The triangle program's input is the integer # the user provides.

**c) Expected Output:** The prime program's output is all prime numbers between 2 and the inputted number. The triangle program comes out as Pascal's triangle and the number of rows.

**d) Type of Execution:** The type(s) of execution for the prime and triangle program is Conditional execution.

**e) Possible Improvements:** The prime program could be improved by: Adding a comma between each number in the print function. 

The triangle could be improved by: In case someone wants to add to my code, I could add some explanations of my code. Making things easier for that person to edit my code.
